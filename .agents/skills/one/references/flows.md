# One Workflows — Multi-Step API Workflows

Workflows chain actions across platforms. Like n8n/Zapier but file-based.

## Before you execute a flow you did NOT author — READ THIS

Nothing about a flow's runtime requirements is guessable from its name. Before `flow execute`, do one of these:

1. **Recommended:** `one --agent flow list` — the JSON output includes `requiresBash`, `usesCodeModules`, `inputs` (with `autoResolvable`), `stepTypes`, and the flow's `description`. Fastest path to knowing what you need.
2. Read the flow's `description` field from the JSON. Authors are required (see "Author conventions" below) to state `--allow-bash` requirements and non-auto-resolving inputs there.
3. `one --agent flow execute <key> --dry-run` to see resolved inputs and step plan without side effects.

If you skip this, you will hit errors like *"Workflow X contains bash steps. Re-run with --allow-bash."* — the CLI pre-flights and fails fast, but the error is entirely avoidable by reading first.

## Author conventions — write flows that are safe to execute blind

The `description` field is the contract with future executors. It MUST state:

- **`--allow-bash` if any step is type `bash`.** e.g. *"Fetches recent Gmail and summarizes with Claude Haiku. Requires `--allow-bash`."*
- **Every input that does NOT have a `connection` hint.** Connection inputs auto-resolve when exactly one matching connection exists; everything else must be passed via `-i name=value`.
- **Any files/directories the flow writes to.**

If a flow's description doesn't tell you how to run it, treat that as a bug in the flow and fix it.

**Storage layout:**

- **Folder layout (REQUIRED for new flows):** `.one/flows/<key>/flow.json`, with an optional `lib/` subfolder for `.mjs` code modules. Like a skill — the folder groups the spec with its helper code, so the whole flow is shareable. **Always create new flows here.**
- **Legacy single-file layout (DEPRECATED):** `.one/flows/<key>.flow.json`. Still loads and runs for backward compatibility, but do not create new flows in this layout. When touching an existing single-file flow, migrate it: move `<key>.flow.json` to `<key>/flow.json` and extract any non-trivial `code.source` blocks into `<key>/lib/*.mjs` modules.

`one flow create` always writes the folder layout.

## Building a Workflow

### Step 0: Design first

Before touching CLI commands:
1. Clarify the end goal — what output does the user need?
2. Map every step required to deliver that output
3. Identify where AI analysis is needed (summarization, scoring, classification)
4. Write the step sequence as a plain list before constructing JSON

Common mistake: jumping straight to `actions search` and building a raw data pipe. Design first.

### Step 1: Discover connections

```bash
one --agent connection list
```

### Step 2: Get knowledge for EACH action

```bash
one --agent actions search <platform> "<query>" -t execute
one --agent actions knowledge <platform> <actionId>
```

You MUST call knowledge for every action in the workflow — it tells you the exact body structure, required fields, and path variables.

### Step 3: Build the workflow JSON

### Step 4: Create

```bash
one --agent flow create <key> --definition '<json>'
```

Or write directly to `.one/flows/<key>/flow.json` (folder layout) or the legacy `.one/flows/<key>.flow.json`.

### Code modules (`lib/` folder)

A `code` step can reference an external `.mjs` module instead of inlining JS as a JSON string:

```
.one/flows/my-flow/
├── flow.json
└── lib/
    └── process-data.mjs
```

```js
// lib/process-data.mjs
const $ = JSON.parse(await new Response(process.stdin).text());
const items = $.steps.fetch.response.data ?? [];
process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(items.filter(i => i.active)));
```

```json
{
  "id": "processData",
  "name": "Process",
  "type": "code",
  "code": { "module": "lib/process-data.mjs" }
}
```

The module runs as a child `node` process: the flow context `$` is piped to stdin as JSON, and stdout is parsed as JSON and used as the step's output. Modules have full Node APIs available (unlike inline `code.source`, which is sandboxed). Use `code.module` for anything non-trivial; keep `code.source` for one-liners.

#### Inline `code.source` sandbox

Inline `code.source` runs inside an async function with a restricted `require`. Only the following Node built-ins are importable:

- `node:buffer`
- `node:crypto`
- `node:url`
- `node:path`

Everything else — `fs`, `http`, `https`, `net`, `child_process`, `process`, `os`, `cluster`, `dgram`, `tls`, `vm`, `worker_threads` — is **blocked** and will throw `Module "<name>" is blocked in code steps`. The runtime also does not expose `process`, `__dirname`, `__filename`, `setTimeout`, or `fetch`.

If you need any of those (filesystem reads, network calls, timers, etc.), use a `code.module` step instead — modules run as a real child `node` process and have the full Node API surface.

When an inline `code.source` step throws at runtime, the error message reports the user-relative line and column plus the offending line of source — e.g. `Code step "blowup" failed at line 3:34\n  const c = $.steps.mk.output.data.score;\n  Cannot read properties of null (reading 'score')`. No need to bisect the step manually.

Whatever JSON a module writes to stdout becomes both `$.steps.<id>.output` and `$.steps.<id>.response` (aliases). Downstream steps can reference either.

### Migrating a legacy single-file flow

If you touch an existing `.one/flows/<key>.flow.json`, migrate it:

1. `mkdir -p .one/flows/<key>/lib`
2. `mv .one/flows/<key>.flow.json .one/flows/<key>/flow.json`
3. Extract non-trivial `code.source` blocks into `lib/<step-id>.mjs` and swap the step config from `{ "source": "..." }` to `{ "module": "lib/<step-id>.mjs" }`. One-liners can stay inline.
4. `one --agent flow validate <key>`
5. Execute and confirm behavior is unchanged.

**Inline source → module translation.** Inline `code.source` is an async function body where `$` is in scope and you `return` the result. A module reads `$` from stdin and writes the result to stdout. Mechanical transform:

Before (inline):
```js
const items = $.steps.fetch.response.data;
return { active: items.filter(i => i.active) };
```

After (`lib/<step-id>.mjs`):
```js
const $ = JSON.parse(await new Response(process.stdin).text());
const items = $.steps.fetch.response.data;
process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({ active: items.filter(i => i.active) }));
```

Two rules: (1) prepend the stdin-read line, (2) replace `return X` with `process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(X))`.

### Step 5: Validate

```bash
one --agent flow validate <key>
```

`flow validate` parses every inline `code.source` and runs `node --check` on every `code.module` file, so syntax errors (brace/paren mismatches, duplicate `let`, etc.) surface here instead of after upstream steps have already run. It also extracts `$.steps.X` and `$.input.X` references from inside `code.source` and `transform.expression` and reports any reference to an undefined step/input or to a step declared **after** the current one (forward references resolve to `undefined` at runtime — silent data loss). The same checks run automatically at the start of `flow execute` so a broken step in position 15 fails the run immediately rather than 15 minutes in.

### Step 6: Execute

```bash
one --agent flow execute <key> -i connectionKey=xxx -i param=value
```

## Workflow JSON Schema

```json
{
  "key": "welcome-customer",
  "name": "Welcome New Customer",
  "description": "Look up Stripe customer, send welcome email",
  "version": "1",
  "inputs": {
    "stripeConnectionKey": {
      "type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "description": "Stripe connection key",
      "connection": { "platform": "stripe" }
    },
    "customerEmail": {
      "type": "string",
      "required": true
    }
  },
  "steps": [...]
}
```

### Input Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `type` | `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array` |
| `required` | Whether input must be provided (default: true) |
| `default` | Default value if not provided |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `connection` | `{ "platform": "gmail" }` — enables auto-resolution |
| `enum` | Array of allowed values; rejected if input doesn't match (post-coercion) |

Connection inputs with a `connection` field auto-resolve if the user has exactly one connection for that platform.

**Validation, coercion, and enums.** At flow start the engine validates every declared input:

1. **Required check** — `required: true` (the default) inputs without a value or `default` cause `Missing required input: "X"`.
2. **Type coercion** — narrow, bidirectional fixes only:
   - `number`: numeric strings (`"5"`) become `5`. Non-numeric strings throw.
   - `boolean`: `"true"`/`"1"`/`1` → `true`; `"false"`/`"0"`/`0` → `false`. Anything else throws.
   - `array` / `object`: JSON strings are parsed. Non-JSON throws.
   - `string`: anything else is `String(value)`-coerced.
3. **Enum check** — if `enum` is set, the (coerced) value must be `===` one of the allowed entries. Errors quote both the allowed list and the actual value.

This eliminates the per-flow `if (!$.input.x) throw ...` boilerplate. Errors look like:

```
Input "tier" must be a number, got string ("lots")
Input "stage" must be one of ["pre_seed","seed","series_a"], got "ipo"
```

The same checks run when a step calls a sub-flow, so type/enum guarantees hold across the call boundary.

## Selector Syntax

| Pattern | Resolves To |
|---|---|
| `$.input.connectionKey` | Input value |
| `$.steps.stepId.response` | Full API response from a step |
| `$.steps.stepId.response.data[0].email` | Nested field with array index |
| `$.steps.stepId.response.data[*].id` | Wildcard — maps array to field |
| `$.env.MY_VAR` | Environment variable |
| `$.loop.item` | Current loop item |
| `$.loop.i` | Current loop index |
| `"Hello {{$.steps.getUser.response.data.name}}"` | String interpolation |

A pure `$.xxx` value resolves to the raw type. A string containing `{{$.xxx}}` does string interpolation.

**Passing objects and arrays:** `{{ }}` interpolation always produces a string — if the resolved value is an object or array it will be JSON-stringified and the engine will log a warning. To pass an object/array as a native value to the next step, use a **direct selector without `{{ }}`**:

```json
// ✗ Wrong — becomes a JSON string, triggers a runtime warning
"files": "{{$.steps.extract.output.allFiles}}"

// ✓ Right — passes the array as an array
"files": "$.steps.extract.output.allFiles"
```

### Context-aware escape pipes (cli#53)

Handlebars interpolations support pipe-based escaping so user-controlled values are safe to embed in shell commands, JSON payloads, URLs, markdown, or HTML without writing per-call escapers:

```json
{
  "command": "curl -d {{$.input.payload | json}} https://example.com/{{$.input.slug | url}}",
  "env": { "GREETING": { "shell": "$.input.name" } }
}
```

Available pipes:

| Pipe | Effect | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| `json` | `JSON.stringify` (handles quotes, newlines, unicode) | `{{$.x \| json}}` → `"O'Brien & Co."` |
| `shell` | POSIX-shell-quote (apostrophes use the `'\''` close-reopen trick) | `{{$.x \| shell}}` → `'O'\''Brien & Co.'` |
| `url` | `encodeURIComponent` | `{{$.x \| url}}` → `O'Brien%20%26%20Co.` |
| `md` | Escape markdown structural characters (` ` ` * _ { } [ ] ( ) # + - ! \| `) | `{{x \| md}}` |
| `html` | Entity-escape `& < > " '` | `{{x \| html}}` → `&lt;b&gt;` |

Pipes can be applied to numbers, booleans, objects, and `null`/`undefined` (which become empty string for shell/url/md/html, `null` for json). An unknown pipe name throws a clear error at flow execution time. Pipes cannot be combined with the legacy `q` prefix — use the pipe form (`{{$.x | shell}}` instead of `{{q $.x}}`).

### Selectors vs expressions

Selectors in data fields (`data`, `queryParams`, `pathVars`, `connectionKey`) are **dot-path lookups only** — they do not support JavaScript operators like `||` or `&&`. For default values, use the `default` field on the input definition:

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "maxResults": { "type": "number", "default": 10 }
  }
}
```

The `if`, `unless`, `condition.expression`, `while.condition`, `transform.expression`, and `code.source` fields **do** support full JavaScript expressions (e.g., `$.input.email && $.input.email.length > 0`).

## Step Types

### `action` — Execute a One API action

```json
{
  "id": "findCustomer",
  "type": "action",
  "action": {
    "platform": "stripe",
    "actionId": "conn_mod_def::xxx::yyy",
    "connection": { "platform": "stripe" },
    "data": { "query": "email:'{{$.input.customerEmail}}'" }
  }
}
```

**Connection forms.** Each action step sets exactly one of:

- **`connection: { platform: "<name>", "tag"?: "<tag>" }`** (preferred) — late-bound, resolved at flow-execute time. Survives re-auth (which always mints a new key). Use `tag` to disambiguate when a platform has multiple connections (e.g. multi-account Gmail). Both `platform` and `tag` accept `$.input.x` selectors so flows can be parameterised per-execution.
- **`connectionKey: "<literal-or-selector>"`** (legacy) — passes the key string straight through. Still supported for backwards compat, but breaks on re-auth and forces manual edits across every flow that references the stale key. Migrate to `connection` when convenient.

The validator rejects an action that sets both forms (or neither) at `flow validate` and `flow execute` time.

### `transform` — JS expression (implicit return)

```json
{
  "id": "extractNames",
  "type": "transform",
  "transform": { "expression": "$.steps.findCustomer.response.data.map(c => c.name)" }
}
```

### `code` — Multi-line JS (explicit return, async, supports await)

```json
{
  "id": "processData",
  "type": "code",
  "code": {
    "source": "const customers = $.steps.list.response.data;\nreturn customers.map(c => ({...c, tier: c.spend > 1000 ? 'gold' : 'silver'}));"
  }
}
```

### `condition` — If/then/else branching

```json
{
  "id": "checkFound",
  "type": "condition",
  "condition": {
    "expression": "$.steps.find.response.data.length > 0",
    "then": [{ "id": "sendEmail", "type": "action", "action": {...} }],
    "else": [{ "id": "logNotFound", "type": "transform", "transform": { "expression": "'Not found'" } }]
  }
}
```

### `loop` — Iterate over an array

```json
{
  "id": "processOrders",
  "type": "loop",
  "loop": {
    "over": "$.steps.listOrders.response.orders",
    "as": "order",
    "maxConcurrency": 5,
    "steps": [...]
  }
}
```

### `parallel` — Run steps concurrently

Use when fetching from 2+ independent data sources before combining results. Each substep must have the full step schema (`id`, `name`, `type`, and type-specific config).

```json
{
  "id": "fetchAll",
  "name": "Fetch email and calendar data in parallel",
  "type": "parallel",
  "parallel": {
    "maxConcurrency": 5,
    "steps": [
      {
        "id": "fetchEmails",
        "name": "Fetch recent emails",
        "type": "action",
        "action": {
          "platform": "gmail",
          "actionId": "conn_mod_def::GmailListMessages::xxx",
          "connectionKey": "$.input.gmailKey",
          "pathVars": { "userId": "me" },
          "queryParams": { "maxResults": 10 }
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "fetchEvents",
        "name": "Fetch today's calendar events",
        "type": "action",
        "action": {
          "platform": "google-calendar",
          "actionId": "conn_mod_def::CalendarListEvents::xxx",
          "connectionKey": "$.input.calendarKey",
          "pathVars": { "calendarId": "primary" },
          "queryParams": { "maxResults": 10 }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

After a parallel step, access each substep's output by its `id`: `$.steps.fetchEmails.response`, `$.steps.fetchEvents.response`.

### `file-read` / `file-write` — Filesystem access

```json
{ "id": "read", "type": "file-read", "fileRead": { "path": "./data/config.json", "parseJson": true } }
{ "id": "write", "type": "file-write", "fileWrite": { "path": "./output/results.json", "content": "$.steps.transform.output" } }
```

### `while` — Condition-driven loop (do-while)

```json
{
  "id": "paginate",
  "type": "while",
  "while": {
    "condition": "$.steps.paginate.output.lastResult.nextPageToken != null",
    "maxIterations": 50,
    "steps": [...]
  }
}
```

### `flow` — Execute a sub-flow

```json
{
  "id": "enrich",
  "type": "flow",
  "flow": { "key": "enrich-customer", "inputs": { "email": "$.steps.get.response.email" } }
}
```

**Dynamic dispatch (cli#61).** `flow.key` accepts a selector (`"$.input.target"`) or Handlebars interpolation (`"{{$.input.prefix}}-{{$.input.suffix}}"`). The resolved key is loaded at runtime, so you can write a single orchestrator that picks among multiple sub-flows based on inputs or upstream results — no bash workaround required. If the resolved key does not exist, the step fails with the standard "flow not found" error.

A sub-flow step exposes the sub-flow's **step results map** at both `.output` and `.response` (they are aliases — pick whichever reads better). Access a specific sub-step's data with:

```
$.steps.<parent>.output.<subStepId>.output.<field>
```

e.g. if sub-flow `enrich-customer` has a step `load` that returns `{ TEAM: "acme" }`, the caller reads it as `$.steps.enrich.output.load.output.TEAM`. There is no longer any `.response.<subStepId>` vs `.output.<subStepId>` ambiguity.

### `paginate` — Auto-collect paginated results

```json
{
  "id": "allMessages",
  "type": "paginate",
  "paginate": {
    "action": { "platform": "gmail", "actionId": "...", "connectionKey": "$.input.gmailKey" },
    "pageTokenField": "nextPageToken",
    "resultsField": "messages",
    "inputTokenParam": "queryParams.pageToken",
    "maxPages": 10
  }
}
```

### `bash` — Shell commands (requires `--allow-bash`)

```json
{
  "id": "analyze",
  "type": "bash",
  "bash": { "command": "cat /tmp/data.json | claude --print 'Analyze this' --output-format json", "timeout": 180000, "parseJson": true }
}
```

**Safe interpolation.** Plain `{{$.input.x}}` does string substitution and is **unsafe** for bash — values containing quotes, `$`, backticks, `&`, etc. will break the command (or worse). Use the `q` helper to POSIX-shell-quote the value:

```json
{ "command": "echo {{q $.input.companyName}} | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'" }
```

`{{q $.input.companyName}}` resolves `O'Reilly Media & Co` to `'O'\''Reilly Media & Co'` — a single argv token bash will parse cleanly. Use `{{q ...}}` for **every** interpolation of user-controlled data into a bash command.

Alternatively, pass values as environment variables (also shell-safe) and reference them with `$VAR`:

```json
{
  "type": "bash",
  "bash": {
    "env": { "COMPANY": "$.input.companyName" },
    "command": "echo \"$COMPANY\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'"
  }
}
```

**Structured env vars (cli#54).** A bash step's `env` map also accepts two structured forms that handle JSON and shell escaping safely without writing temp files by hand:

```json
{
  "type": "bash",
  "bash": {
    "env": {
      "PAYLOAD_FILE": { "json": "$.steps.buildConfig.output" },
      "COMPANY":      { "shell": "$.input.companyName" }
    },
    "command": "curl -X POST $ENDPOINT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @$PAYLOAD_FILE && echo \"$COMPANY\""
  }
}
```

- `{ "json": <selector|value> }` — the resolved value is JSON-serialized, written to a temp file, and the env var is set to the temp file's path. Use it with `curl -d @$VAR` or `cat $VAR`. The temp file is cleaned up automatically after the step finishes (success OR failure).
- `{ "shell": <selector|value> }` — the resolved value is exposed as a plain string env var. Reference it inside bash double quotes (`"$VAR"`) so bash itself handles word-splitting.
- A plain string value (`"COMPANY": "$.input.companyName"`) is the legacy form — interpolated as-is.

This is the recommended way to pass structured payloads to `curl`, `claude --print`, or any CLI that expects a JSON file. It eliminates the older `file-write → bash` two-step workaround.

## Step Input Contracts (`requires`)

Declare the data a step depends on so the engine fails fast — with a useful error — when an upstream value is missing. Without `requires`, a skipped or failed upstream step silently leaves `undefined` in the context and the consumer either crashes deep in user code or burns an LLM call on empty input.

```json
{
  "id": "summarizeFounder",
  "type": "code",
  "requires": [
    "$.steps.fetchProfile.output.bio",
    "$.input.founderName"
  ],
  "code": { "module": "lib/summarize.mjs" }
}
```

Each entry is a `$.input.X` or `$.steps.X.output...` selector. A selector is considered missing when it resolves to `undefined`, `null`, `""`, or `[]` (empty objects are allowed). On a miss, the engine throws **before** the step runs:

```
Step "summarizeFounder" requires $.steps.fetchProfile.output.bio but it
resolved to undefined (upstream step "fetchProfile" was skipped)
```

The "because…" suffix tells you exactly why — skipped, failed, or timed out — so you can fix the upstream wiring instead of guessing.

`requires` failures honor the step's `onError` strategy: pair `requires` with `onError: { strategy: "continue" }` to skip optional consumers gracefully, or leave the default `fail` to halt the flow on contract violations.

Forward references are caught at flow load time: if `requires` points at a step declared after the current step, validation rejects the flow.

## Step Output Contracts (`outputSchema`)

Declare the shape of a step's `output` so the validator can catch field-name typos in downstream selectors at flow load time — long before a misspelled `$.steps.research.output.charCount` silently resolves to `undefined` at runtime:

```json
{
  "id": "research",
  "type": "flow",
  "flow": { "key": "company-research" },
  "outputSchema": {
    "company": "string",
    "research": "string",
    "charCount": "number",
    "quality": { "confidence": "string", "coverageScore": "number" }
  }
}
```

Field types: `"string"`, `"number"`, `"boolean"`, `"object"`, `"array"`, `"unknown"`. Nest objects to describe sub-fields (`quality.coverageScore` above). Anything not declared is rejected when referenced via `$.steps.<id>.output.<field>` from a downstream step:

```
Selector "$.steps.research.output.chars" references field "chars" which is not
declared in step "research".outputSchema. Either fix the field name or update
the outputSchema declaration.
```

`outputSchema` is purely a documentation / validation aid — the engine does **not** enforce the shape at runtime, so a code step that returns an unexpected field still works (it just won't be discoverable from typed selectors). Schemas declared on a step apply to all references from anywhere in the flow tree (including inside loops, conditions, parallel blocks, code, and transform expressions).

## Error Handling

```json
{ "onError": { "strategy": "retry", "retries": 3, "retryDelayMs": 1000 } }
```

Strategies: `fail` (default), `continue`, `retry`, `fallback`.

**Retry backoff.** By default each retry waits exactly `retryDelayMs`. For rate-limited APIs add `"backoff": "exponential"` (or `"exponential-jitter"`) and an optional `"maxDelayMs"` cap (defaults to 30000):

```json
{
  "onError": {
    "strategy": "retry",
    "retries": 4,
    "retryDelayMs": 1000,
    "backoff": "exponential-jitter",
    "maxDelayMs": 10000
  }
}
```

`exponential` waits `retryDelayMs * 2^(retryIndex)` (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s…) capped at `maxDelayMs`. `exponential-jitter` multiplies each wait by a random factor in [0.5, 1.0) so concurrent retries spread out.

**Conditional retry (cli#53).** By default a `retry` strategy retries every error. To distinguish transient failures (rate-limits, timeouts) from permanent ones (auth errors, 404s) add `retryOn` and/or `failFastOn`:

```json
{
  "onError": {
    "strategy": "retry",
    "retries": 4,
    "backoff": "exponential",
    "retryOn":    [429, 502, 503, "ETIMEDOUT", "ECONNRESET"],
    "failFastOn": [401, 403, 404]
  }
}
```

- `failFastOn` takes precedence: if the error matches any entry, the step fails immediately without consuming retries.
- `retryOn` (when set): the error must match an entry to be retried; non-matching errors fail immediately.
- If neither is set the legacy "retry every error" behavior applies.

Match rules: number entries are compared against any 3-digit token in the error message (covers `HTTP 429`, `status 502`, etc.); string entries match `error.errorCode` exactly OR appear as a case-insensitive substring of the message (covers Node error codes like `ETIMEDOUT` and our own `TIMEOUT`).

**Inspecting retry outcomes.** Every retried step exposes how it ended on its `StepResult`:

- `$.steps.<id>.status` — `"success"` or `"failed"`
- `$.steps.<id>.retries` — number of retries actually performed (0 if first attempt succeeded)
- `$.steps.<id>.error` — last error message (only set when `status === "failed"` under `continue`/`fallback` strategies)

A successful-after-retry step also emits a `step:retry-success` event with the retry count, so you can distinguish a clean first-attempt success from a recovered one in logs.

Conditional execution: `"if": "$.steps.find.response.data.length > 0"`

## AI-Augmented Patterns

### When to use parallel steps

Use `parallel` when your workflow fetches from 2+ independent data sources before combining them. Common patterns:
- Fetch Gmail + Calendar + Sheets → compile into daily briefing
- Search Exa + scrape with Firecrawl → merge research data
- Query BigQuery + list Google Drive files → combine for analysis

Each substep inside `parallel.steps` must have the full step schema: `id`, `name`, `type`, and the type-specific config (`action`, `code`, etc.). Follow a parallel step with a `code` or `transform` step to combine the results.

### file-write -> bash -> code

When raw data needs analysis, use this pattern:
1. `file-write` — save data to temp file (API responses are too large to inline)
2. `bash` — call `claude --print` to analyze (set timeout to 180000+, use `--output-format json`)
3. `code` — parse and structure the AI output for downstream steps

## CLI Commands

```bash
one --agent flow create <key> --definition '<json>'
one --agent flow list
one --agent flow validate <key>
one --agent flow execute <key> -i key=value
one --agent flow execute <key> --dry-run -i key=value
one --agent flow execute <key> --dry-run --mock -i key=value
one --agent flow execute <key> --skip-validation -i key=value
one --agent flow execute <key> --allow-bash -i key=value
one --agent flow runs [flowKey]
one --agent flow resume <runId>
```

## Important Notes

- **Prefer passthrough actions over custom actions.** Custom actions add server-side fan-out that causes timeouts at scale. The flow runner handles pagination, retries, and rate limiting locally. Search with `-t knowledge` to find passthrough endpoints (e.g. GET `/gmail/v1/users/{userId}/threads` instead of POST `/gmail/get-threads`)
- Connection keys are inputs, not hardcoded — makes workflows portable
- Action IDs in examples are placeholders — always use `actions search` to find real IDs
- Code steps support `require('crypto')`, `require('buffer')`, `require('url')`, `require('path')` — `fs`, `http`, `child_process` are blocked
- Bash steps require `--allow-bash` flag
- Action steps validate required params before executing — pass `--skip-validation` to bypass
- `--mock` now returns realistic example data from action schemas (instead of echoed config)
- State is persisted after every step — resume picks up where it left off
- For bash+Claude steps, always set timeout to 180000+ and run sequentially (not in parallel)
